<h2>D3 Charter - Simple D3.js-powered Charts in Wordpress</h2>

<p>This Wordpress plugin allows easy embedding of simple D3.js charts using shortcodes. Copy the folder into your plugins directory and activate it.</p>

<p>The shortcode interface in WordPress:</p>

<pre><code>[d3chart title="Chart Title" 
        subtitle="Chart Subtitle"
        type="bar|barHoriz|line" 
        margin_left="40"
        chart_width="450"
        chart_height="400"
        data="data-filename.csv"
        keyposition="top-right|top-left|bottom-right|bottom-left"
        dateformatter="%-m/%-d/%y"]
</code></pre>

<p>The simplicity of the plugin relies on the data files being formatted to the plugin&rsquo;s specifications:</p>

<ol>
<li>The bar charts for now can only have one series. Line charts can have multiple data series. (Multiple series in bar charts coming soon.)</li>
<li>The data must be in a comma separated file.</li>
<li>For bar charts, the first row must have column headings and those headings must be x and y, in that order. See the <strong>data</strong> directory of this repository for examples. Obviously, these correspond to the x and y axes. Note that for horizontal bar charts, x and y are swapped.</li>
<li>For line charts, the first row must have column headings, and the first column must be called &lsquo;Date&rsquo; and include the time series information. The subsequent columns can be called whatever you like, and they represent subsequent data series. Again, look at the examples in the <strong>data</strong> folder. The dates default to the mm/dd/yy format, but date parsing can be customized using the &lsquo;dateformatter&rsquo; shortcode attribute. See https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Time-Formatting for all the time formatting options available.</li>
<li>For now, only line charts have keys. The key&rsquo;s position can be adjusted using the &lsquo;keyposition&rsquo; shortcode attribute.</li>
<li>The data file needs to be uploaded into Wordpress&rsquo;s media library. Once uploaded, just make sure to enter the same filename into the &lsquo;data&rsquo; field in the shortcode. The plugin does the rest. <em>Note: if you re-upload new data for an old post, the link may break. The plugin relies on the post&rsquo;s publish date to keep the data in sync.</em></li>
</ol>
